Adafruit-GFX-dummy-display aims to provide a virtual display to develop graphics using Adafruit-GFX-Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) without hardware.

It is currently using libgraph (https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libgraph/) and runs under Linux.

It is not an Adafruit project.
